# Revised Plan of Action for Parallel Inference Implementation

1. Create a new class `ParallelAIUtilities` in parallel_inference.py:
   - This class will be optimized for parallel processing of multiple prompts.
   - It will use the modified `process_api_requests_from_file` function from oai_parallel.py.

2. Implement methods in `ParallelAIUtilities`:
   - `run_parallel_ai_completion(prompts: List[LLMPromptContext])`: For handling multiple completion requests.
   - `run_parallel_ai_tool_completion(prompts: List[LLMPromptContext])`: For handling multiple tool completion requests.

3. Create helper functions:
   - `prepare_requests_file(prompts: List[LLMPromptContext])`: To convert a list of LLMPromptContext objects into JSONL format compatible with oai_parallel.py.
   - `parse_results_file(filepath: str)`: To convert the results from JSONL back into a list of LLMOutput objects.

4. Update the `OAIApiFromFileConfig` class:
   - Add a field to specify the client type (OpenAI or Anthropic).
   - Ensure it includes all necessary configuration options for both APIs.

5. Modify the `process_api_requests_from_file` function:
   - Ensure it properly handles both OpenAI and Anthropic API calls with the current implementation.
   - Verify that error handling and retrying work correctly for both APIs.

6. Update the `parallel_inference_example.py` script:
   - Demonstrate how to use the new `ParallelAIUtilities` class with multiple prompts.
   - Show examples of parallel processing for both OpenAI and Anthropic APIs in a single batch.
   - Include examples of mixing different models and configurations in a single batch.

7. Implement proper logging and error handling throughout the new implementation.

8. Update the existing utility functions in utils.py to support the parallel processing workflow:
   - Modify `msg_dict_to_oai` and `msg_dict_to_anthropic` to handle batches of messages if needed.

9. Ensure compatibility with the existing `LLMPromptContext`, `LLMConfig`, and `LLMOutput` classes:
   - Update these classes if necessary to support batch processing.

10. Add appropriate type hints and docstrings to all new functions and classes.

11. Implement a batching mechanism in `ParallelAIUtilities`:
    - Group prompts by model and configuration to optimize API calls.
    - Handle cases where prompts in a list may use different models or configurations.

12. Implement thorough testing:
    - Create unit tests for new functions and classes.
    - Test with various scenarios, including rate limiting and error cases.
    - Ensure correct handling of mixed model/configuration batches.
    - Verify that results are correctly matched to their original prompts.

13. Update the README.md file:
    - Include information about the new parallel processing capabilities.
    - Provide examples of how to use the new ParallelAIUtilities class with multiple prompts.
    - Explain the benefits and considerations of batch processing.

14. Optimize for performance:
    - Implement asynchronous file I/O for preparing requests and parsing results.
    - Consider adding a progress bar or real-time status updates for large batches.

15. (Optional) Implement a fallback mechanism:
    - If parallel processing fails, attempt to process prompts sequentially using the original AIUtilities class.

16. Conduct final review and refactoring:
    - Ensure code consistency across all modified files.
    - Remove any redundant or unused code.
    - Verify that all TODOs have been addressed.
